## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting fraud in cyber security transactions. The system utilizes 
various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze transactional data and identify potentially fraudulent activities.
By employing advanced algorithms, the system can adapt to evolving fraud patterns and provide accurate predictions in real-time.

**Tools:-** Excel,Python

[Datasets Used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yp_rcOS2TbVn-wHUIsCeCzkeDP7MIPLP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102868121048017441192&rtpof=true&sd=true )

[Python Script (Code)](cyber_security.ipynb)

[Ppt presentation](sql_prjct.pptx)

### Features 

- Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the transactional data for analysis.
  
- Supervised learning: Train classification models to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
  
- Model evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using relevant metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Requirements

- Python 3

- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Sklearn, etc.

- Jupyter Lab

## Balancing an unbalanced dataset:
```py
#So, we can do Undersampling technique to balance the datasets otherwise As you can see, this model is only predicting 0, which means itâ€™s completely ignoring the minority class in favor of the majority class.
df_majority = sample[sample.Attack == 0]
df_minority = sample[sample.Attack == 1]
df_majority_undersample = df_majority.sample(replace = False, n = 144503, random_state = 123)#random_state it's won't shuffle if we run this multiple time
b_sample = pd.concat([df_majority_undersample, df_minority])
print(b_sample.Attack.value_counts())
b_sample.shape
```
```py
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (8,5))
b_sample.Attack.value_counts().plot(kind='bar', color= ['blue','green'], alpha = 0.9, rot=0)
plt.title('Distribution of data based on the Binary attacks of our balanced dataset')
plt.show()
```
###### Result:

## Model evaluation:
#### Decision Tree Algorithm
```py
ds=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
ds.fit(x_train,y_train)
train_pred=ds.predict(x_train)
test_pred=ds.predict(x_test)
print(accuracy_score(train_pred,y_train))
print(accuracy_score(test_pred,y_test))
```
```py
#creating list for train test accuracy
train_test = ['Train','test']
aucc = [dt_aucc,dt_test] 
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
# Plot the bar graph
bars = plt.bar(train_test, aucc, color=['green', 'skyblue'])
#Add Labels and title 
plt.xlabel('Decision Tree')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Accuracy Comparison for train test')
#Show the plot
plt.show()
```
